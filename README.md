# Kuzushiji_MNIST

Kuzushiji (くずし字) Dataset Classification Problem
The Kuzushiji dataset is created by the National Institute of Japanese Literature (NIJL), and is curated by the Center for Open Data in the Humanities (CODH).

The Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset which focuses on Kuzushiji(cursive Japanese) is a classification problem similar to the MNIST dataset. It contains images of the first ten entries from the main Japanese hiragana character groups.

Kuzushiji-MNIST is a drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale, 70,000 images), provided in the original MNIST format as well as a NumPy format.

The images are storred in numpy arrays of 60,000 x 28 x 28 and 10,000 x 28 x 28, respectively. The labels are also stored in two numpy arrays, one for train and another for the test set.
